## 1. Overview
The use case diagram below shows the business process of delivering food to a student. Ther are four actors, the client, the cook, the delivery person, and the boss. The client accesses the system and places their order. The client must also input the classroom and building they want to food to be delivered to. After the order is submitted, it gives the total amount that the student needs to pay and the students account is charged. The order confirmation is then sent to the cook. The food is then cooked by the cook and given to the delivery person. The delivery person must then deliver the food to the assigned classroom in the assigned building. The client must be in the assigned classroom 5 minutes before the delivery person arrives.
